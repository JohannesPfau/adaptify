<!-- %%%% Main Recognizer %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<!-- This recognizer describes a bend from the hips towards the floor. It resembles a bowing motion with the arms loosely hanging downwards -->
<!-- trying to touch the floor. Unfortunately, the nature of this motion leads to some serious occlusion problems with the kinect. Since we -->
<!-- lean forward our upper body occludes the rest of our body for the most part. Thus, angular tracking of key vertices in FUBI does not   -->
<!-- show satisfying tracking results. This recognizer tackles this problem with heuristic means. Instead of tracking the motion itself we  -->
<!-- resort to tracking certain limb constellations that force the human body to do a Rumpfbeuge in order to reach them naturaly. In this   -->
<!-- case we check if the hands are positioned below the knees while the torso is bend forward. Note: This is not cheat proof! E.g. sitting -->
<!-- on the floor with straight legs while placing the hands on the knees will be tracked as a Rumpfbeuge too!                 				-->
