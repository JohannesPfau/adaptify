<!-- %%%% Recognizer Parts %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% --> 

<!-- Recognizing the left arm being extended-->
<!-- For this recognizer we only check for the relation of the shoulder and the hand. A major part of adaptifys target group is elderly people. -->
<!-- Since we do not want elbow flexibility to be a factor in this exercise we allow arms to be bend as long as they are extended to the sides. -->
<JointRelationRecognizer name= "LeftHandOnShoulderHeight">
	<Joints main="leftHand" relative="leftShoulder"/>
    <MaxValues y="400"/>    	<!-- Adjust these values to adjust the arm tolerance for the left arm! *2 -->
    <MinValues y="-400"/>
</JointRelationRecognizer>

<!-- Recognizing the right arm being extended-->
<!-- For this recognizer we only check for the relation of the shoulder and the hand. A major part of adaptifys target group is elderly people. -->
<!-- Since we do not want elbow flexibility to be a factor in this exercise we allow arms to be bend as long as they are extended to the sides. -->
<JointRelationRecognizer name= "RightHandOnShoulderHeight">
	<Joints main="rightHand" relative="rightShoulder"/>
    <MaxValues y="400"/>		<!-- Adjust these values to adjust the arm tolerance for the right arm! *2 -->
    <MinValues y="-400"/>
</JointRelationRecognizer>

<!-- Recognizing the left leg being elevated -->
<!-- Only the relation of hip and knee are taken into account. This is not cheat proof. Sitting yields the same results! -->
<JointRelationRecognizer name= "RightLegCocked">
	<Joints main="rightHip" relative="rightKnee"/>
	<MaxValues y="150"/>		<!-- Adjust these values to adjust the tolerance for the right leg! *2 -->
	<MinValues y="-150"/>
</JointRelationRecognizer>

<!--*1 The values are measured in seconds. Thus, 1 equals one second while 0.1 equals 100 milliseconds -->	
<!--*2 The values are measured in millimeters and refer to the height (y-axis) of the hand/knee relative to the position of the shoulder/hip. -->
