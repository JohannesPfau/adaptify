<!-- This recognizer describes an upper body lean to the right from a standing position. The feet should be approximately shoulder wide -->
<!-- apart. Only the upper body is taken into account when trying to track the motion (apart from the feet distance).                   -->

<!--*1 The values are measured in seconds. Thus, 1 equals one second while 0.1 equals 100 milliseconds -->
<!--*2 The values are measured in angular degrees. An exact vertical line orthogonal to the floor is regarded as 0 degrees -->
<!--*3 The values are measured in millimeters and refer to the distance of the right foot to the left foot. -->
