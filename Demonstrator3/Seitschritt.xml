<!-- %%%% Main Recognizer %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<!-- This recognizer describes a step to the left or the right from a neutral standing position. -->
<!-- Due to unknown circumstances while tracking it seems to not really make a difference which foot moves to which side. I suspect the   -->
<!-- coordinates are calculated relative to a point that is itself dynamically calculated in the middle of the two joints in question.    -->
<!-- Thus, moving the right foot to the right seems to produce the same result as moving everything except the right foot away from it    -->
<!-- to the left. If position (0|0) is dynamically recalculated this could explain why both motions seem to produce the same change       -->
<!-- along the x-axis -->
