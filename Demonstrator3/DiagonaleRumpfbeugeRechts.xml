<!--*1 The values are measured in seconds. Thus, 1 equals one second while 0.1 equals 100 milliseconds -->	
<!--*2 The values are measured in angular degrees. An exact vertical line orthogonal to the floor is regarded as 0 degrees-->
<!--*3 The values are measured in millimeters and refer to the horizontal distance (x-axis) of the hand relative to the position of the knee. -->
